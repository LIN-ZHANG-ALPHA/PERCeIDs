Description of Matlab functions:deflation_demo.m: it is a demo function to compute the CP decomposition of a generated N-order tensor using deflation-based algorithms. The function allows: * The inclusion of Gaussian noise;* The choice between real or complex tensors;* The choice of rank-1 approximation methods: SeROAP and THOSVD.dcpd.m: computes the CP decomposition using iterative deflation. The outputs are each rank-1 component of the tensor and the residual. The choice of the rank-1 approximation method, the maximum number of iterations and the precision of the decomposition are input parameters that are set in deflation_demo.m function.SeROAP.m: computes a rank-1 approximation using the sequential rank-1 approximation and projection algorithm.T_HOSVD.m: computes a rank-1 approximation using the truncated high-order singular value decomposition algorithm.CE.m: Coupled-Eigenvalue method for three-way tensors that improves any rank-1 approximation method. The inputs are some tensor T and a rank-1 approximation X.krondecomp.m: computes the Kronecker decomposition of a Hermitian matrix M.generateTensor.m: generate a real or complex tensor whose entries of its factor matrices are uniformly distributed in [-1,1].contract.m: performs the inner product between two tensors.outer.m: computes the outer product of N tensors.unfold.m: writes a tensor T in a particular unfolding representation.refold.m: Recover the tensor from a particular unfolding matrix.REFERENCES:
